# padlock

## tool that helps me stay focused.


# How does it work?

### 1. Set a focus tab and set a duration to stay focused for
### 2. Forces you to stay on that tab until the duration ends 


## Planned functions 
1. create whitelist for links: 
   a. any links from the focus tab can be accessed and will automatically be added into the whitelist
2. include a focus history, or use AI to suggest the next target (based on previous focus tabs and durations
3. have multiple whitelist profiles that the user can fall back to
4. find a way to stop alt-tabbing (not sure if this is possible with web extensions)


### Additional Notes
So far this is only a web extension, the most it can do is to stop the user from changing tabs within the same browser. 
Users can still get away with alt-tabbing which kinda sucks
Leaving the extension tool here but will work on building a more powerful app to prevent alt tabbing too.
