# padlock

## browser extension that helps me stay focused.


# How does it work?

### 1. Set a focus tab and set a duration to stay focused for
### 2. Forces you to stay on that tab until the duration ends 




## Proposed functions:
1. create whitelist for links: 
   a. any links from the focus tab can be accessed and will automatically be added into the whitelist
2. include a focus history, or use AI to suggest the next target (based on previous focus tabs and durations
3. have multiple whitelist profiles that the user can fall back to
